# Contabo → `/root/MoonieXHQ` migration plan — DRAFT

Status: **draft, nothing moved.** Waiting for the CEO's approval of the names and the order.
Author: CTO 0e8d80b8, 2026-09-23. Survey read-only over ssh the same day.

## Why

CEO 2026-09-23: all work on Contabo lives in **one folder**, named exactly like the
Mac HQ — the rules already written in `MoonieXHQ/MAP.md` and IRON §54:
`MoonieXHQ` (no space), PascalCase, no hyphens, `Projects/<Brand>/<Suffix>` ⇔
`PASAKON/<Brand>-<Suffix>`. Tools that are installed separately stay outside.

Today the same repo has a different path on each machine (`/opt/mooniex-agents` vs
`~/MoonieXHQ/Agents/Core`), work is spread over `/opt`, `/root/projects` and loose
`/root/*` folders, and every doc carries a per-machine path table. Since `~` is
`/root` on Contabo, one root name means `~/MoonieXHQ/...` in any doc or config
resolves correctly on both machines (ADR 0030's `work_dir.root: ~/MoonieXHQ/Work`
already does).

```

`*` = new row, not on the Mac map yet — the name needs the CEO's yes (and whether it gets
a `PASAKON/MoonieX-<Suffix>` repo). `/root/arb` (no git, cron every 15 min) has no brand
yet → `UNKNOWN/` until the CEO says which project it belongs to.

## Stays outside (tools)

`/opt/node-v22`, `/opt/usage` (agy/codex feeds + serve containers), `/opt/claude-usage-monitor`,
`/opt/disk-monitor`, `/opt/containerd`, `/docker/n8n`, `/root/.acme.sh`, `/root/idm-venv`
(regenerable venv), Docker volumes (org-postgres etc.), `~/.cache`, `~/.npm`.

Z.ai leftovers — `/opt/zai-usage-monitor`, `zai-usage-monitor.service`, container
`zai-usage-serve` — Z.ai was dropped by the CEO 2026-09-20. Proposed for removal, separate go.

## What must be repointed (measured 2026-09-23)

| Kind | Items |
|---|---|
| systemd units (8) | `mooniex-drive-broker`, `mooniex-drive-photo-broker`, `mooniex-secretary-waker`, `mooniex-secretary`, `mooniex-sompong-photo-filer` (all `/opt/mooniex-agents`), `mooniex-console` + `mooniex-console-cert-renew` (`/opt/mooniex-console`), `mooniex-line-queue` (line-automation venv) |
| docker compose (2 projects) | `mooniex-claudeflow` (working_dir + bind `data/`), `mooniex-option` (3 containers) |
| cron | `/root/arb/scan_v2.py` — only if arb moves |
| Agents-Core | root `CLAUDE.md` Contabo table, `scripts/cto-claude.sh` + `cxo-claude.sh` (`WIKI_ROOT_*=/opt/...`), the Mac→Contabo rsync lines, Console config that launches C-level sessions from `/opt/mooniex-agents`, any `config/*.yaml` host paths — grep `/opt/` and `/root/projects` before the move |
| Claude Code | transcript slug `-opt-mooniex-agents` → `-root-MoonieXHQ-Agents-Core`: same trap as Mac step ④b (a symlinked slug broke tool-result spill) — make the new slug a real dir with `memory/` linked |
| venvs | `.venv` shebangs carry absolute paths: they keep working through the compat symlink; rebuild (`python -m venv --clear` + `pip install -r`) before the symlink is removed |
| `hq.yaml` | every row gets a `contabo:` path so `hq.py doctor` can judge this box too |

## Method (same as Mac step ④b)

Per folder: stop its units/containers → `mv` → compat symlink old path → new path →
repoint unit/compose → `systemctl daemon-reload` + start → verify (port, health URL, logs)
→ next folder. Before each edit, tar the unit and compose files (rollback = remove the
link, `mv` back, restore the files). Compat links are removed only after a clean week,
like Mac step 5.

Order, lowest risk first:
1. `Archive/` + `Assets/` — no services.
2. `Agents/Rules`, `Agents/Wikis`, `Agents/Memory` — change the rsync targets in the same commit.
3. Projects without services — AlphaTrader, LinePoster.
4. Services one at a time — LungNote/Mcp, LineAutomation, Option, ClaudeFlow, Console.
5. `Agents/Core` last — only while both Contabo CTO sessions are idle; restart them after.

Downtime estimate (not measured): about a minute per service while it restarts.

## Needs the CEO

1. Approve the tree and names above.
2. Names for the new rows: LineAutomation, LinePoster, Option; which project `arb` belongs to.
3. `/root/restore` (2.4 GB, June-13 restore bundle incl. an env bundle with secrets): archive
   (secrets → Infisical first) or delete?
4. Remove the Z.ai leftovers?
5. Delete the two old tarballs `mooniex-agents-preGitSwap-20260807-093707.tgz` (119 MB) and
   `mooniex-agents-preSync-20260807-074856.tgz` (32 MB)?

## Done the same day (CEO go 2026-09-23)

- Docker build cache pruned (10.31 GB), journal vacuumed to 500 MB (3.4 GB), pip cache removed (539 MB).
- `/root/idm-packs` removed: 47 shards, 12,290,070,828 bytes, md5 47/47 equal to Drive
  `BACKUP/CookieRun Backup/colab_packs` (`1dHtISY1PRVyT5tEP4kr3SqK7zIAJFjpT`); logged in
  `~/.claude/logs/drive-archive.log`. Restore: `rclone copy` that folder, or repack from
  `play_rec` with `windows/cookierun_pack_for_colab.py`.
- Free space 17 GB → 42 GB.
- `/opt/mooniex-agents`: remote → `git@github.com:PASAKON/Agents-Core.git`, fast-forward
  44a8a525 → aaf07343. Services were **not** restarted; they run the old code until their next restart.
